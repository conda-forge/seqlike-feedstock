  description: |
    SeqLike is a Python package that lets you conveniently manipulate 
    biological sequences.
    It solves some of the following problems:

    1. Sequence representation inter-conversion (AA vs. NT, and 
       str/Seq/SeqRecord/arrays) via a single object's API.
    2. Processing a collection of sequences easily in Python without 
       needing to switch out to a shell.
    3. Convenience APIs to visualize of a collection of sequences.

## NOTE: >> DO NOT REMOVE THIS NOTE TO AVOID PLAUSIBLE CONFUSION IN FUTURE
#
#  SUMMARY: The three recipes (seqlike, weblogo, python-codon-tables) 
#           were managed by bioconda channel. Since the creators of 
#           seqlike wanted it on conda-forge, we ported all three 
#           libraries from bioconda channel to conda-forge channel, 
#           with permission from bioconda-core-team. The other two 
#           libraries (weblogo, python-codon-tables) are dependencies 
#           of `seqlike`.
#
#  TODO: 
#         1. Remind bioconda team to remove "seqlike" from 
#            bioconda channel, to complete the transfer of 
#            "seqlike" from bioconda to conda-forge. [DONE]
#
#         2. Ask the maintainers of bioconda:seqlike whether 
#            to add them to the maintainers' list here. [DONE]
